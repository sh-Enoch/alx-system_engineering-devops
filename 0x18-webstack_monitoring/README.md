Monitoring is a crucial aspect of managing any system, including web servers like Nginx. Here’s why it’s needed and the main areas it covers:

Why Monitoring is Needed:
Feedback and Improvement: Monitoring provides regular, timely feedback on the implementation of a program or project, identifying areas that require improvement and making adjustments to ensure intended outcomes are achieved1.
Transparency and Accountability: It results in better transparency and accountability, allowing stakeholders to have more input and organizations to maintain integrity2.
Efficiency: Monitoring helps ensure resources are used efficiently, preventing waste and optimizing performance2.
Learning from Mistakes: It allows organizations to learn from their mistakes and successes, improving decision-making for future projects2.
Two Main Areas of Monitoring:
Quality: Monitoring the quality of services or products being delivered or developed.
Risk: Identifying and managing potential risks that could impact the project or system3.
Access Logs for a Web Server:
Request Records: Access logs are records of all requests made to the server, including the request method (GET, POST, etc.), the requested URL, and the user agent4.
Server Response: They also include information about the server’s response, such as the status code and the size of the response4.
Usage Analysis: These logs are used to analyze traffic patterns, troubleshoot issues, and optimize performance.
Error Logs for a Web Server:
Diagnostic Information: Error logs contain diagnostic information about any errors encountered while processing requests5.
Problem Resolution: They are essential for understanding what went wrong and how to fix it, making them the first place to look when a problem occurs with the server.
